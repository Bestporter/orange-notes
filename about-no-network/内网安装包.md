The pip `download` command lets you download packages without installing them:

```
pip download -r requirements.txt
```

(In previous versions of pip, this was spelled

 `pip install --download -r requirements.txt`.)

Then you can use

 `pip install --no-index --find-links /path/to/download/dir/ -r requirements.txt` 

to install those downloaded sdists, without accessing the network.

If the package is on PYPI, download it and its dependencies to some local directory. E.g.

```console
$ mkdir /pypi && cd /pypi
$ ls -la
  -rw-r--r--   1 pavel  staff   237954 Apr 19 11:31 Flask-WTF-0.6.tar.gz
  -rw-r--r--   1 pavel  staff   389741 Feb 22 17:10 Jinja2-2.6.tar.gz
  -rw-r--r--   1 pavel  staff    70305 Apr 11 00:28 MySQL-python-1.2.3.tar.gz
  -rw-r--r--   1 pavel  staff  2597214 Apr 10 18:26 SQLAlchemy-0.7.6.tar.gz
  -rw-r--r--   1 pavel  staff  1108056 Feb 22 17:10 Werkzeug-0.8.2.tar.gz
  -rw-r--r--   1 pavel  staff   488207 Apr 10 18:26 boto-2.3.0.tar.gz
  -rw-r--r--   1 pavel  staff   490192 Apr 16 12:00 flask-0.9-dev-2a6c80a.tar.gz
```

If you want to install your app and its dependencies into the current python environment, you'll do something like this:

```
$ cd ~/src/myapp
$ easy_install --always-unzip --allow-hosts=None --find-links=/pypi .
```

In both cases, the build will fail if one or more dependencies aren't present in `/pypi` directory. It won't attempt to promiscuously install missing things from Internet.

I highly recommend to invoke `setup.py develop ...` and `easy_install ...` within an active [virtual environment](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html) to avoid contaminating your global Python environment. It is  (virtualenv that is) pretty much the way to go. Never install anything  into global Python environment.

If the machine that you've built your app has same architecture as  the machine on which you want to deploy it, you can simply tarball the  entire virtual environment directory into which you `easy_install`-ed everything. Just before tarballing though, you must make the virtual environment directory relocatable (see [--relocatable](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html#making-environments-relocatable) option). **NOTE:** the destination machine needs to have the same version of Python  installed, and also any C-based dependencies your app may have must be  preinstalled there too (e.g. say if you depend on [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/), then libpng, libjpeg, etc must be preinstalled).
